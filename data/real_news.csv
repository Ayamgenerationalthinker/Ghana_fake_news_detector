1,$1.2bn worth of gold smuggled during economic crisis – Finance Minister Ato Forson,"Ghana’s Minister for Finance, Dr Cassiel Ato Forson, has revealed that 60 tonnes of gold, worth an estimated $1.2 billion, were smuggled out of the country at the height of the economic crisis in 2022.
He made this revelation in a social media post highlighting the scale of the illicit gold trade and its devastating impact on the national economy.
“This nation-wrecking act has gone on for far too long, and the consequences have been very dire,” he stated.
Dr Forson pointed out that the value of the smuggled gold was nearly half of the $3 billion bailout Ghana sought from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to stabilise the economy.
He lamented that smuggling operations have deprived the country of much-needed foreign exchange and development resources. “Imagine $12 billion translating into foreign exchange and supporting Ghana’s reserves position,” he wrote.
The Finance Minister underscored the urgency for bold action, calling for firm and decisive measures against those sabotaging Ghana’s economy.
Dr Forson also pledged his support for the Ghana Gold Board and noted progress in curbing smuggling.",REAL,https://www.myjoyonline.com/1-2bn-worth-of-gold-smuggled-during-economic-crisis-finance-minister-ato-forson/
2,"Ghana’s 24-Hour Economy policy: Energy demand, supply, and investment requirements","Ghana’s 24-hour economy policy aims to transform the nation into a round-the-clock hub for industry, commerce, and services, boosting productivity and economic growth. However, this ambitious vision depends on reliable and sustainable electricity supply.
The feasibility of the program depends on electricity demand and supply, as the policy is a manufacturing-led initiative involving agro-processing and industrial parks across the country.
The 24-hour economy policy introduces new infrastructure demands, including industrial parks, agro-ecological zones, and digital hubs, requiring increased electricity capacity.
Expanding capacities in alignment with future demand is projected to cost about $10 billion by 2030, including grid improvement, off-grid solutions, and efficiency upgrades.",REAL,https://www.myjoyonline.com/ghanas-24-hour-economy-policy-energy-demand-supply-and-investment-requirements-2/
